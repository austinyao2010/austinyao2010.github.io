            Hi! My name is Austin Yao. I live in Cincinnati, Ohio, and I go to Mason Middle School. I am 13 years old and in 7th grade. 
            I'm a determined student who isn't afraid of tackling challenges and sharing victories - academically and socially. Being 
            heavily involved in community service, I enjoy initiating projects. I'm a curious person, and I have many passions to share!

                      <li>
                        I initiated a free “Swim with a Splash” event for my community where I offered 
                        free private lessons to kids. 
                      </li>
                      <br>
                      <li>
                        I recruited a few peers to teach, assigned specific roles such as coach and 
                        assistant coach, and created a flyer for our community bulletin board, also advertising by social media and 
                        word of mouth. Using information from each child's Google registration form, I created individual lesson plans 
                        for the swimmers and assigned them to a coach according to the coach's strengths. Safety was a priority, so I 
                        assigned two coaches per child.
                      </li>
                      <br>
                      <li>
                        Many times, we had to adapt to unexpected situations. One day, it started raining. 
                        I had planned for it to be outdoors at the neighborhood pool, but due to the bad weather, I moved it to the 
                        community center. I had to notify all the parents, and we kept going.
                      </li>
                      <br>
                      <li>
                        We had to adjust again as our youngest student, who was just three years old, was 
                        hesitant to get into the pool. I had one of our assistant coach's younger brother lead him into the water and 
                        assigned an assistant coach to supervise them both. The boy ended up loving the lesson so much that he was 
                        willing to jump into the deeper pool. When his mom saw how comfortable he was, she immediately signed up her 
                        older child for a lesson too!
                      </li>
                      <br>
                      <li>
                        Surprisingly, we had an adult sign up for a lesson. At first, she only wanted to 
                        have one class, but after we gave her professional feedback about her kicking and pulling, she happily had three
                        classes. 
                      </li>
                      <br>
                      <li>
                        We taught eleven individuals over three days, confidently giving parents feedback 
                        after each lesson. The classes weren't easy, especially since the students were all at different levels. To make 
                        one child feel comfortable being in the pool, I had to hold him the entire time he kicked. He was pretty heavy, 
                        and I struggled to lift my arms the next day. Finally, after two days of hard work, he was able to hold his 
                        breath underwater, which was a huge accomplishment. Later, his mom said that he now likes swimming and wants 
                        to take more lessons.

                    When I was 6, I chose to learn how to play the violin, despite knowing it is a difficult instrument and requires a 
                    lot of standing, which is excruciating at times. Over the years, it is something I have been increasingly passionate 
                    about, as I love playing the beautiful songs. Every night when I go to bed, I turn on classical music, and it helps 
                    me quickly fall asleep.

                        Swimming is my main sport, and I love it because I've learned to be strong mentally
                        and to push myself. I have swum since I was 3 years old, and it's been an exciting journey. At the beginning of 
                        the season last year, I was not very confident, but I made great strides during the Long Course Season. 
                      </li>
                      <br>
                      <li>
                        In my group, we had lettered lanes: A, B, C, and D, with D being the slowest. 
                        I would always go to the C lane, but my coach pushed me out of my comfort zone and moved me to the A lane. Later, 
                        during the goal meeting, my coach inspired me again, and I became determined to become a better swimmer. From then 
                        on, I took every practice seriously and never wanted to skip. 
                      </li>
                      <br>
                      <li>
                       I ended up the 2nd fastest swimmer in the group. In fact, I was reluctant to go on
                        vacation because I loved practice so much! Previously, I had rushed through the drills, but now I went slowly to 
                        work on my technique. During the Long Course season, my swimming propelled forward, and I moved to the fastest 
                        group for my age and made every single Junior Championship cut for state!

                    I've played basketball since I was 7 years old, and I wanted to be a basketball player when I grew up. I also enjoy 
                    watching NBA games. My idol is Stephen Curry, and I admire him for his grit and determination. Despite being 
                    undersized and doubted by most scouts, he pushed on, and he is now one of the faces of the NBA. Today, my main 
                    interest has switched to oncology, but Stephen Curry still inspires me to try to be better every day.

                    I've enjoyed playing tennis for two years and play a lot. I'm in T3 Junior, the second highest level in my tennis 
                    league, Harper's Point. I'm proud that I've been able to achieve this level of tennis in such a short amount of time. 
                    Despite being busy with other extracurriculars, I continue playing tennis because I enjoy the strategy involved in the 
                    sport, and I can share the game with friends.

                    I have an affinity for math. I've read many books about math and have heard interesting stories and learned about 
                    famous equations such as Fermat's Last Theorem—an equation that shook the mathematical world. I've watched YouTube 
                    videos and read books about it, and it still amazes me how the problem was around for decades before it was finally 
                    solved. Math is fascinating to me, and I will appreciate it forever.

                    There are so many wonders of the world, and we continue to unveil new discoveries every day. I enjoy studying science,
                    and I'm  intrigued that there is so much to learn. As a child, I read many books about black holes, redshift, and the
                    Big Bang theory. This long-lasting interest in science prompted me to study Earth and Space on my Science Bowl team in 
                    middle school.

                      In my gifted class, we played the stock market game, which lasted for three months. 
                      At first, my partner and I were cautious. When we wanted to invest in a stock, we'd watch it for a while before 
                      spending any money, and if our shares took a dip, we'd sell them immediately to avoid a loss. However, we weren't 
                      making very much profit! 
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                      We realized we needed to take some risks. We targeted tech companies, such as ASML 
                      and NVDA, because people got addicted to video games during Covid. Also, we bought Merck & Co's stock, because they 
                      had just introduced a skin cancer vaccine, which was something novel. I remember celebrating with my partner as ASML 
                      grew a historic $70 in a single day. Even though we started slow and sometimes lost money, we learned quickly and 
                      watched some of our stocks skyrocket in the final days of our game.

                  <br>
                    <li>
                      Surprisingly, with only two people, we placed 2nd out of all our school teams. This 
                      experience was motivating and made me feel confident about investing in the future. Today, with some help from my 
                      father, I invested in the real stock market, and one of my stocks has grown by 20%!

                    In my free time, I started playing chess on the chess.com platform. I never took lessons, so I spent most of my 
                    screen time learning it and discovered it's quite a unique game. I love playing the “bullet” game mode where players 
                    have only one minute on the clock to make their next move, requiring fast thinking and calculation. Now, I've reached 
                    a 1300 rating, which is the 94th percentile among all players. Overall, chess is a game I will cherish forever, and I 
                    marvel that I was able to find a hobby that is so much fun!

                    Because I'm a big fan of the NBA, it was easy to get hooked on a basketball video game: NBA 2K Mobile. I was able to 
                    pretend that I was coaching the game, using my favorite players to try to win. I felt extremely accomplished whenever 
                    I was able to reach a high level, and I found that this video game is a great way for me to relax after a long day.

                        I live with my parents, sister, and grandma, and one of my favorite family traditions 
                        is Chinese New Year because our family gets to bond and celebrate the start of a new year. One of the special 
                        activities we look forward to the most is watching the CCTV Spring Festival Gala. I love the feeling of 
                        togetherness that we have when we pile on the couch to enjoy the skits, singing, and shows broadcasted from China. 
                        The performances are amazing, and we even watch reruns of previous years because it is so fascinating.

                      <li>
                        We also eat delicious food: dumplings, noodles, spring rolls, and many other 
                        traditional dishes. We laugh and talk as we eat, and discuss the new zodiac animal for the coming year. 
                        (For instance, 2024 is the Year of the Dragon) After dinner comes my favorite part: the red envelopes. 
                        Every Chinese New Year, the adults give the kids fancy red envelopes with money inside. This is an old tradition, 
                        and by giving the envelopes, you are wishing the receiver good luck and prosperity. We also dress up in red and 
                        record greetings for our friends and family.

                        My family taught me to be compassionate and help those in need, so when I saw a kid 
                        standing alone at a tennis camp who came from South Korea to the US to study American tennis, I asked for his 
                        name, but he didn't speak English. It was hard to communicate, but we figured it out. Under my guidance, he 
                        became more outgoing and fun and quickly made a lot of friends. I was happy for him and felt sad when he went 
                        back to South Korea.

                    I have 2 cats, Mi Mi (pronunciation: Mee - Mee) and Rockette. It was a cold, gray morning when we first encountered 
                    Mi Mi, who was a stray cat. We fed her, and she hung around our house. It was starting to get colder, and we had 
                    concerns that Mi Mi wouldn't be able to survive under these bitter conditions, so we brought her from shelter to 
                    shelter, wanting to find her a good home. We couldn't find the owner, and the shelter didn't want her, so we decided 
                    to adopt her, and we were happy. To make sure Mi Mi isn't lonely, we decided to find her a friend, so we adopted 
                    Rockette, a 6-month-old kitten. Rockette was found underneath a trailer, and she was brought to PetSmart, which is 
                    where we got her.
