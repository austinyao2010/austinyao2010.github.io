            Hi! My name is Austin Yao. I live in Cincinnati, Ohio, and I go to Mason Middle School. I am in 7th grade, and I am 13 years old.
            I'm a curious child, and I have many passions that I would like to share!

            I have a plethora of hobbies, ranging from academics to stocks?!

        <h3 class="title-math"> Math</h3>
            <div class="math-paragraph">
                <p>
                    I have an anffinity for doing math, and it is something I'm really passionate about. Last year, in 6th grade, I qualified for state. This was a feat
                    that I'm really proud of because I was competing against 7th and 8th graders. I think math is something really fascinating, and I 
                    will enjoy forever.

        <h3 class="science-title"> Science</h3>
            <div class="science">
                <p>
                    Science is so fascinating. There are so many wonders of the world, and we continue to unviel new things every day. I
                    enjoy studying science, and it amazes me that there is so much to learn. As a child, I read books about black holes, redshift, 
                    etc, and this prompted me to study Earth and Space on my Science Bowl Team.

        <h3 class="swimming-title"> Swimming </h3>
            <div class="swimming">
                <p>
                    Swimming is my main sport, and I love it because you have to push yourself and be strong mentally. I've swam since I was 10,
                    and I have had quite a journey. At the beginning of the season last year in August, I was not very confident in my swimming, but I 
                    made great strides forward in the Long Course Season. We had lettered lanes, and it went A lane, B lane, C lane, then D lane, with 
                    D being the slowest lane. I would always go to the C lane, and never wanted to step out of my comfort zone, so when my coach moved
                    me to the A lane, I moved back to C. Later, I ended up going to B, and staying there. Later, during the goal meeting, my coach inspired
                    me, and I changed. I was determined to become a better swimmer, and I took every practice very seriously, and never wanted to skip. I 
                    moved to A cycle, and became the 2nd fastest swimmer in the group. In fact, I was reluctant to go on vacation because I loved practice 
                    so much! I used to rush through the drills, but I went slowly to work on my technuique. During the Long Course Season, my swimming 
                    propeled forward, and I achieved every single Junior Championship time, along with a few AA and Atimes, and barely missing the AAA time for 
                    50 Meter Breast by a second. Now, in this year's short course season, I have moved up to the fastest group for my age, and I have 
                    gotten the AAA time for 50 Breast, along with some AA and A times. Swimming is something I love a lot, and look forward to doing.

        <h3 class="basketball-title"> Basketball </h3>
                <div class="basketball">
                    <p>
                        I've played basketball since I was 7 years old. I also really enjoy watching the NBA, and it prompted me to want to become 
                        a basketball player when I grow up. I am now interested in oncology, but basketball was a huge thing to me when I was little.
                        My idol was Stephen Curry, and I always admired him for his grit and determination. Despite being undersized and doubted by
                        most scouts, he pushed on, and he is now one of the faces of the NBA. He inspired me, and I strive to be better every day.

        <h3 class="tennis-title"> Tennis </h3>
                <div class="tennis">
                    <p>
                        I've played tennis for 2-3 years, and I enjoy it a lot. I was able to get to T3 Junior, the second highest level 
                        in Harper's Point, which is where I play tennis. I'm proud that I am able to get to this level of tennis in only 
                        a few years, and it is something pretty difficult to do.

        <h3 class="violin-title"> Violin </h3>
                <div class="violin">
                    <p>
                        I've played violin since I was 5. This is an accomplishment I am most proud of is getting into the Cincinnati 
                        Junior Strings Orchestra because I think I had a lot of obstacles in my way that I had to overcome. I enjoy
                        playing violin a lot. When my family moved to Cincinnati, my sister and I went to  a very famous violin teacher, 
                        asking her if she could teach us. She said that I have physical limitations that make playing violin difficult 
                        because I am double jointed in every finger, and I have a curved pinky. She recommended that I should play a 
                        different instrument. I truly love this instrument despite the obstacles that I would need to face, so I 
                        decided to keep going. I went to a different violin teacher. It was hard to balance all the activities such as 
                        playing basketball, swimming, tennis, and doing math, along with playing violin, but I did it. A year later, the violin 
                        teacher reached out to my mom, and said that she wanted to teach me because she was very impressed by my 
                        determination and she wanted to help me so that I could get into the Cincinnati Junior Strings 
                        Orchestra. The Cincinnati Junior String Orchestra auditions were looming ahead, so I had played at least 2 and a 
                        half hours a day. I practiced for an entire month, and the hard work really paid off when I got in. In the end, I 
                        learned that commitment is really important. If you have a passion for something, no one is able to stop you from 
                        doing what you want to do. I am really glad I stuck with violin, and I am very happy that I could get into the 
                        Orchestra that I always wanted to get in.

                        Swim with a Splash:

                        I held a free “Swim with a Splash” event for my community because I had drastically improved in swimming, and I wanted to help other kids become better too. As I organized this class, I developed the new skill of project planning.  
                        There were many details I had to coordinate. I recruited a few peers to teach and assigned specific roles to avoid conflicts. Using Canva, I created a flyer for our community bulletin board and Facebook and also advertised by word of mouth. Using the information the parents had given to me on a Google form, I made individual lesson plans for each swimmer and assigned them to a coach according to the coach's strengths.
	                    We taught eleven kids over three days, confidently giving parents feedback after each lesson. The classes weren't easy, especially since one student was scared of water. It took two days to get him comfortable being in the pool, but he learned how to hold his breath underwater, which was a huge accomplishment. Later, his mom said that he now likes swimming and wants to take more lessons. Project planning requires a lot of thought and hard work, but the end result is really satisfying. 

                        International Food Drive:

                        I was a part of a food drive for Cincinnati AACO Youth Member (Asian-American Coalition of Ohio Youth Chapter) International Food Drive for the University of Cincinnati's Bearcats Pantry,
                        where I was able to gather money and food items for families of graduate students in need.

        <h3 class="chess-title"> Chess </h3>
                <div class="chess">
                    <p>
                        I started playing chess in 6th grade, and I have improved Immensely. I had played for hours and hours with countless
                        lessons. I played on chess.com, and I improved by playing against many bots until I finally beat the 1600 elo bot.
                        (In chess, we call rating "elo", so if your "elo" is 1600, your rating is 1600.) I went from 200 elo in blitz to 1000
                        elo, and improved to an impressive 1300 elo bullet and 1000 rapid. Chess is something I really enjoyed and I think I made
                        a lot of progress in a mere one year.

        <h3 class="stocks-title"> Stocks </h3>
                <div class="stocks">
                    <p>
                        In gifted class, we played the stock market game, which lasted for three months. At first, my partner and I were cautious. When we wanted to invest in a stock, we'd watch it for a while before spending any money, and if our shares took a dip, we'd sell them immediately to avoid loss. However, we weren't making very much profit.
                        We decided to take some risks. We targeted tech companies, such as ASML and NVDA, because people got addicted to video games during Covid. Also, we bought Merck & Co's stock, because they had just introduced a skin cancer vaccine, which was something novel. I remember celebrating with my partner as ASML grew a historic $70 in a single day. 
                        This experience was memorable to me because it introduced me to a new activity and taught me that it is necessary to take risks if you want big rewards. Even though we started slow and sometimes lost money, we learned quickly and watched some of our stocks skyrocket in the final days. Surprisingly, with only two people, we placed 2nd out of all our school teams. This experience was fascinating and made me feel confident about investing in the future. 
                        This prompted me to actually invest in real life by asking my dad to invest the money in the stocks I asked him to, and I've already earned over 13% of the stock's value.
